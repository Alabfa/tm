# TM

TM is short for (Track Masturbating), It is simply a mobile app that is used to track your masturbation with the ability to edit or delete your records if your wish to try it you can go to releases and download the app.
- If you are on ANDROID you can directly install the .apk app without any problem.
- On IOS things are different so if you wish to install the app there are many different ways to install it, the simpelest one is to install [Scarlet](https://usescarlet.com/) first on your iPhone and then follow these steps:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Alabfa/tm/blob/main/Instructions%20image/github%20learn%201.png"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Alabfa/tm/blob/main/Instructions%20image/github%20learn%202.png"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Alabfa/tm/blob/main/Instructions%20image/github%20learn%203.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

then it will pop up an installation confirmation alert just click "install".
